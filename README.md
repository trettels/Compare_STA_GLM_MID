Documentation for STA/STC, MID, and GLM Code

The maximally informative dimensions code referred to in this program was derived from code from Dr. Tatyana Sharpee's lab for finding maximally informative dimensions in one dimension, and adapted for use in MATLAB and for use under different conditions by Sean Trettel.  Linear minimization functions and non-gradient search algorithms were derived from Numerical Recipes Third Edition.  Generalized Linear Model and Maximum Likelihood code is from Dr. Jonathan Pillow's lab, modified only in order to facilitate use in line with the other functions in this program.
